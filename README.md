## 📚 Project Context

> This project was created during my training at **gibb** as part of the *Modul 122 LB2* course.  
>  
> The main goal was to learn **Python programming**, **Regex validation**, and **SQLite database integration**.  
>  
> I previously built a similar program in **PowerShell**, but this Python version adds:
> - Database persistence
> - Regex-based input validation
> - Improved console design
